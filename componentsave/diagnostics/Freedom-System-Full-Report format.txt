Create an report that a high schooler can understand in pdf, markdown, GitHub README, and summary dashboard format with three sections: architecture, mapping, and manifest. 
Call it Freedom-System-Full-Report-2025-06-21.

For outlines and lists, format sub levels with an additional "-" at the beginning of each level.
Include emojis at the top level of each section in the report.

You have my permission to analyze the freedom_system folder on my F: drive and on my GitHub. Based on your analysis create the following sections:
For the mapping, create a collapsed list of the next level folders in the componentsave folder, then the expanded list down to last subfolder and files.
For the architecture, create a collapsed list, then the expanded list, down to last subfolder and files.
For the manifest, create a collapsed list, then the expanded list, down to last subfolder and files.
Include a visual tree diagram of the structure.
For each category, include a description of what I want to accomplish.
Include optional tasks from your todo list.

Review the entire Freedom Project and include in the report where all components should go in their respective categories within the componentsave folder. Current categories are attached. 

Include percentage done by project and categories.
