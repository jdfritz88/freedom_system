# Ooba Coqui API Notes

### 💡 Summary of What Happened:
- Oobabooga has a built-in OpenAI-compatible API server → runs on port **5000**
- The Coqui TTS extension (the actual voice server) runs a **separate Flask API server** → runs on port **8020**
- You tested both:
  - Port 5000: ❌ returned `"Not Found"` → because it’s not the speech API
  - Port 8020: ✅ returned success and generated a voice clip

### ✅ Correct Manual Test Command
```cmd
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8020/tts ^
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" ^
     -d "{\"text\": \"Hello, this is a test.\"}"
```

### 📌 API Roles and Purpose
| Port | Role                            | Owned By     | Notes                                 |
|------|----------------------------------|--------------|---------------------------------------|
| 5000 | OpenAI-compatible LLM API       | Oobabooga    | For sending prompts to the language model |
| 8020 | Coqui XTTS Voice API            | Extension    | For converting text to speech         |
| 7860 | Web UI                          | Oobabooga    | Main GUI for interaction              |

### 🎯 Reminder
You don’t send TTS to port 5000. You send it to **8020**, which belongs to the Coqui TTS extension inside Oobabooga.
