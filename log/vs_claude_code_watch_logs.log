VS Code + Claude Code: Watching Console Logs
==============================================
Last updated: 2026-02-02

PURPOSE
-------
This guide explains how to monitor your application logs in real-time
using VS Code, and how to feed that output to Claude Code so it can
help you debug errors and understand what your applications are doing.


SETUP (ALREADY DONE)
--------------------
- VS Code installed at: F:\Apps\VSCode\Code.exe (portable mode)
- Claude Code extension installed inside VS Code
- VS Code Tasks configured in: F:\Apps\freedom_system\.vscode\tasks.json
- Log files stored in: F:\Apps\freedom_system\log\


HOW TO OPEN VS CODE
-------------------
1. Double-click F:\Apps\VSCode\Code.exe
2. If your project doesn't open automatically:
   - File > Open Folder > navigate to F:\Apps\freedom_system
3. Your project files appear in the left sidebar (Explorer panel)


HOW TO OPEN THE TERMINAL PANEL
------------------------------
1. Press Ctrl + `  (backtick key, next to the 1 key on your keyboard)
   - This toggles the terminal panel at the bottom of VS Code
2. You can have multiple terminal tabs open at once
3. To create a new terminal tab, click the + button in the terminal panel
4. To rename a terminal tab, right-click its name and select "Rename"


HOW TO START CLAUDE CODE
------------------------
1. Open a terminal (Ctrl + `)
2. Type: claude
3. Press Enter
4. Claude Code is now running inside VS Code
5. Rename this terminal tab to "Claude" (right-click the tab > Rename)

NOTE: If you get a PowerShell execution policy error, run this once:
   Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope CurrentUser -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned
   Type Y and press Enter to confirm.


HOW TO WATCH A LOG FILE (THE EASY WAY - VS CODE TASKS)
-------------------------------------------------------
Pre-configured tasks exist for all major log files. To use them:

1. Press Ctrl + Shift + P  (opens the Command Palette)
2. Type: Run Task
3. Select "Tasks: Run Task"
4. Pick from the list:
   - Watch Log: boredom_monitor
   - Watch Log: boredom_monitor_extension
   - Watch Log: boredom_detector_extension
   - Watch Log: boredom_config_sync_extension
   - Watch Log: boredom_api_client_extension
   - Watch Log: alltalk_operations
   - Watch Log: injection_test
   - Watch Log: textgen_troubleshooting
5. A new terminal tab opens showing the last 50 lines of that log
6. New lines appear in real-time as your application writes to the log
7. You can run multiple log watchers at the same time

To stop watching: Click the terminal tab running the watcher, then press Ctrl + C


HOW TO WATCH A LOG FILE (MANUAL WAY)
-------------------------------------
If you want to watch a log that doesn't have a pre-configured task:

1. Open a new terminal tab (click + in the terminal panel)
2. Type this command, replacing the filename with your log:

   Get-Content -Path "F:\Apps\freedom_system\log\YOUR_LOG_NAME.log" -Tail 50 -Wait

   Example:
   Get-Content -Path "F:\Apps\freedom_system\log\boredom_monitor.log" -Tail 50 -Wait

3. The -Tail 50 means "start by showing the last 50 lines"
4. The -Wait means "keep watching for new lines"
5. Rename the terminal tab so you remember what it's watching


HOW TO LET CLAUDE SEE YOUR LOG OUTPUT
--------------------------------------
This is the whole point -- getting Claude to read your running logs.

1. Make sure you have at least two terminals open:
   - One running Claude Code (your "Claude" terminal)
   - One or more watching logs (from the tasks above)

2. In your Claude terminal, when typing a prompt, type the @ symbol

3. A dropdown appears listing your named terminal tabs
   - Select the log terminal you want Claude to read

4. Claude now sees whatever output is currently showing in that terminal

5. Ask your question, for example:
   - "Are there any errors in this output?"
   - "What is the boredom monitor doing right now?"
   - "Why did the server throw that exception?"

6. You can reference multiple terminals in a single prompt by using
   @ multiple times


LOG FILE LOCATIONS
------------------
All logs are saved to: F:\Apps\freedom_system\log\

Current log files:
  boredom_monitor.log              - Main boredom monitor log
  boredom_monitor_extension.log    - Boredom monitor extension log
  boredom_detector_extension.log   - Boredom detector extension log
  boredom_config_sync_extension.log - Config sync extension log
  boredom_api_client_extension.log - API client extension log
  alltalk_operations.log           - AllTalk TTS operations log
  injection_test.log               - Injection test log
  textgen_troubleshooting.log      - Text-gen troubleshooting log
  claude_code_voice_mode.log       - Voice mode log
  startup_scanning_log.txt         - Startup scanning log


ADDING A NEW LOG WATCHER TASK
-----------------------------
If a new log file gets created and you want a one-click task for it:

1. Open the file: F:\Apps\freedom_system\.vscode\tasks.json
2. Copy one of the existing task blocks (everything between { and })
3. Paste it at the end of the tasks list (before the final ] bracket)
4. Change the "label" to your new log name
5. Change the filename in the "command" line to match your new log file
6. Save the file

Example task block to copy:

        {
            "label": "Watch Log: your_new_log",
            "type": "shell",
            "command": "Get-Content -Path '${workspaceFolder}/log/your_new_log.log' -Tail 50 -Wait",
            "presentation": {
                "reveal": "always",
                "panel": "dedicated",
                "group": "logs"
            },
            "isBackground": true,
            "problemMatcher": []
        }


KEYBOARD SHORTCUTS QUICK REFERENCE
-----------------------------------
Ctrl + `              Open/close the terminal panel
Ctrl + Shift + P      Open the Command Palette (search for any command)
Ctrl + Shift + `      Create a new terminal tab
Ctrl + C              Stop a running command (like a log watcher)
@                     (Inside Claude prompt) Reference a terminal's output


TROUBLESHOOTING
---------------
Problem: "claude" command not found or script error
Fix: Run this in the terminal:
   Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope CurrentUser -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned

Problem: Log file not found when running a task
Fix: Check that the log file exists in F:\Apps\freedom_system\log\
     The file must exist before you can watch it.

Problem: No output appearing in log watcher
Fix: The application that writes to that log might not be running.
     Start your server or extension first, then watch the log.

Problem: @ doesn't show terminal list in Claude
Fix: Make sure you renamed your terminal tabs. Claude lists them by name.
     Right-click the terminal tab > Rename.
