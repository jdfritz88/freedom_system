# Systematic Troubleshooting Process for Freedom System

This document establishes a systematic troubleshooting methodology based on systematic principles and successful resolution patterns from the Freedom System project.

---

## 🛡️ DISCIPLINE ENFORCEMENT STANDARDS

**CRITICAL**: These standards prevent quick-fix behaviors and ensure systematic troubleshooting:

### Anti-Pattern Prevention
You MUST NOT exhibit these behaviors:
- **Assumption-Based Solutions**: NEVER propose fixes based on assumptions without verification
- **Architecture Abandonment**: NEVER suggest switching architectures as a first solution
- **Design Disrespect**: NEVER ignore documented design decisions without understanding why they exist
- **Quick Fixes**: NEVER implement workarounds that bypass the actual problem
- **Placeholder Values**: NEVER use temporary or placeholder values as solutions

### Required Discipline
Before proposing ANY solution:
- Verify the problem with actual tests, not assumptions
- Respect existing architecture - understand before changing
- Address root causes, not symptoms

---

## 🔍 CORE TROUBLESHOOTING METHODOLOGY

The systematic approach follows five essential phases:

### Phase 1: Problem Definition
**Ask yourself:** "What exactly is failing and how do I know it's failing?"

```python
def define_problem():
    """Systematic problem definition questions"""
    questions = [
        "What are the specific symptoms?",
        "What was the expected behavior?", 
        "When did this start happening?",
        "What changed recently?",
        "Can I reproduce this reliably?",
        "What error messages are shown?",
        "What do the logs actually say?"
    ]
    
    for question in questions:
        print(f"[ANALYSIS] {question}")
        # Document each answer before proceeding
```

⚠️ **MANDATORY VERIFICATION**:
- You MUST run actual commands to reproduce the issue before proceeding
- You MUST NOT proceed to Phase 2 until you have actual error output
- You MUST NOT say "probably" or "likely" - verify or say "unknown"

### Phase 2: Analysis and Investigation  
**Ask yourself:** "What are all the possible causes and how can I test them?"

```python
def systematic_investigation():
    """Multi-layer analysis approach"""
    
    # Layer 1: Surface level analysis
    print("[ANALYSIS] Checking obvious issues...")
    check_obvious_failures()
    
    # Layer 2: System level analysis  
    print("[ANALYSIS] Examining system interactions...")
    analyze_component_interactions()
    
    # Layer 3: Deep architecture analysis
    print("[ANALYSIS] Investigating architectural patterns...")
    examine_underlying_architecture()
    
    # Layer 4: Root cause analysis
    print("[ANALYSIS] Finding fundamental cause...")
    trace_to_root_cause()
```

⚠️ **INVESTIGATION REQUIREMENTS**:
- You MUST test each possible cause with real commands
- You MUST NOT skip investigation layers even if you think you know the answer
- You MUST show command output that proves/disproves each hypothesis

### Phase 3: Solution Generation
**Ask yourself:** "What are multiple ways to solve this and which is most robust?"

⚠️ **SOLUTION DISCIPLINE**:
- You MUST NOT implement quick fixes that bypass the problem
- You MUST NOT use placeholder values or workarounds or dummy code or shortcuts or stubs or nubs
- You MUST first understand WHY the current architecture was chosen
- The proper_fix MUST address the root cause, not symptoms

```python
def generate_solutions():
    """Create solution approaches - NO quick fixes or workarounds or dummy code or shortcuts or stubs or nubs"""

    # First, understand the current architecture
    print("[ANALYSIS] Understanding why current architecture was chosen...")
    print("[ANALYSIS] Ask user: Where should I look for design decisions? (analysis.md, README, commit history?)")
    research_current_design_rationale()

    solutions = {
        # "immediate_fix" - REMOVED: No quick patches allowed
        "proper_fix": "Address root cause systematically",
        "architecture_correction": "If proven wrong, implement correct architecture",
        "preventive_measures": "Prevent recurrence",
        "monitoring_improvements": "Detect similar issues faster"
    }

    for solution_type, description in solutions.items():
        print(f"[SOLUTION] {solution_type}: {description}")
```

### Phase 4: User Approval
**Ask yourself:** "Have I clearly explained my proposed solution and received user approval?"

⚠️ **MANDATORY USER APPROVAL**:
- You MUST NOT implement any solution without explicit user approval
- You MUST present solutions in plain language (no jargon without explanation)
- You MUST wait for user response before proceeding

**Requirements:**
1. Present the solution(s) you have identified in clear, accessible language - the user is an adult, not a student, so be direct and concise without being condescending
2. Be prepared to answer questions from the user about the proposed solution
3. Wait for the user to explicitly approve a solution before moving to implementation

```python
def get_user_approval():
    """Present solution and wait for user approval"""

    # Present solution clearly
    print("[SOLUTION] Here is what I found and propose to fix:")
    print("[SOLUTION] Problem: <clear description>")
    print("[SOLUTION] Root cause: <clear explanation>")
    print("[SOLUTION] Proposed fix: <what will be changed>")
    print("[SOLUTION] Files affected: <list of files>")

    # Wait for approval
    print("[WAITING] Do you approve this solution? (yes/no/questions)")
    # DO NOT PROCEED until user responds
```

### Phase 5: Implementation with Validation
**Ask yourself:** "How do I implement this safely and verify it works?"

```python
def implement_with_validation():
    """Safe implementation with validation"""
    
    # Pre-implementation validation
    backup_current_state()
    document_changes()
    prepare_rollback_plan()
    
    # Implementation
    apply_fix()
    
    # Post-implementation validation
    test_fix_effectiveness()
    verify_no_regressions()
    update_monitoring()
```

⚠️ **IMPLEMENTATION SAFEGUARDS**:
- You MUST test the fix in isolation first
- You MUST NOT implement without preparing rollback plan
- You MUST verify the fix addresses root cause, not just symptoms

### Phase 6: Evaluation and Prevention
**Ask yourself:** "Did this fully solve the problem and how do I prevent it happening again?"

```python
def evaluate_and_prevent():
    """Evaluation and prevention analysis"""
    
    # Effectiveness evaluation
    measure_problem_resolution()
    identify_remaining_risks()
    
    # Prevention measures
    update_standards()
    improve_monitoring()
    document_lessons_learned()
    enhance_testing_coverage()
```

⚠️ **EVALUATION REQUIREMENTS**:
- You MUST document what was actually wrong vs your initial assumptions
- You MUST identify if you made any incorrect assumptions during troubleshooting
- You MUST update docs if your understanding of the design was wrong

## 🛠️ ENHANCED LOGGING SYSTEM

### Universal Logging Function
**Always implement enhanced logging early in troubleshooting:**

```python
def log_enhanced(message, level="INFO", function_name="", component="SYSTEM"):
    """Enhanced logging with timestamp and function tracking"""
    import datetime
    
    timestamp = datetime.now().strftime("%H:%M:%S.%f")[:-3]
    prefix = f"[{component}]"
    
    if function_name:
        prefix = f"{prefix} [{function_name}]"
    
    full_message = f"{prefix} [{level}] {message}"
    print(full_message)
    
    # Also write to log file
    log_file = "F:/Apps/freedom_system/log/troubleshooting.log"
    try:
        with open(log_file, "a", encoding="utf-8") as f:
            f.write(f"{timestamp} {full_message}\n")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"[LOGGING] Failed to write to log file: {e}")

# Example usage throughout troubleshooting
def troubleshoot_function():
    log_enhanced("Starting troubleshooting process", "INFO", "troubleshoot_function")
    
    try:
        # Investigation code here
        log_enhanced("Investigation step completed", "SUCCESS", "troubleshoot_function")
    except Exception as e:
        log_enhanced(f"Investigation failed: {str(e)}", "ERROR", "troubleshoot_function")
```

### API-Specific Enhanced Logging

```python
def log_api_request(endpoint, payload, response=None, error=None):
    """Enhanced logging for API troubleshooting"""
    import json
    
    log_enhanced(f"API Request to {endpoint}", "INFO", "log_api_request", "API")
    log_enhanced(f"Payload: {json.dumps(payload, indent=2)}", "DEBUG", "log_api_request", "API")
    
    if response:
        log_enhanced(f"Response Status: {response.status_code}", "INFO", "log_api_request", "API") 
        log_enhanced(f"Response Headers: {dict(response.headers)}", "DEBUG", "log_api_request", "API")
        log_enhanced(f"Response Body: {response.text[:500]}", "DEBUG", "log_api_request", "API")
    
    if error:
        log_enhanced(f"API Error: {str(error)}", "ERROR", "log_api_request", "API")
        log_enhanced(f"Error Type: {type(error).__name__}", "ERROR", "log_api_request", "API")

# Example API troubleshooting with enhanced logging
def test_api_endpoint(endpoint, payload):
    log_enhanced("Starting API endpoint test", "INFO", "test_api_endpoint", "API")
    
    try:
        import requests
        response = requests.post(endpoint, data=payload, timeout=10)
        log_api_request(endpoint, payload, response=response)
        
        if response.status_code == 500:
            log_enhanced("Server Error 500 detected - investigating server logs", "WARNING", "test_api_endpoint", "API")
            investigate_server_error(response)
        
        return response
        
    except Exception as e:
        log_api_request(endpoint, payload, error=e)
        return None

def investigate_server_error(response):
    """Investigate server-side errors systematically"""
    log_enhanced("Analyzing server error response", "INFO", "investigate_server_error", "API")
    
    # Check for common patterns
    if "file" in response.text.lower() and "not found" in response.text.lower():
        log_enhanced("Likely file path issue detected", "WARNING", "investigate_server_error", "API")
    
    if "Please Refresh Settings" in response.text:
        log_enhanced("Placeholder value being used as actual parameter", "ERROR", "investigate_server_error", "API")
```

## 🎯 SYSTEMATIC QUESTIONING FRAMEWORK

### Self-Questioning Process
**Always ask these questions in sequence:**

```python
def systematic_self_questions():
    """Framework for systematic self-questioning during troubleshooting"""
    
    problem_definition_questions = [
        "What exactly is the error message?",
        "What was I trying to accomplish?", 
        "What should have happened instead?",
        "Can I reproduce this error consistently?",
        "What were the exact steps that led to this error?"
    ]
    
    analysis_questions = [
        "What components are involved in this operation?",
        "Which component is actually failing?",
        "Are there multiple systems that need to communicate?",
        "What assumptions am I making that might be wrong?",
        "Am I looking at the right logs/files?",
        "Are there other similar systems I can compare against?"
    ]
    
    solution_questions = [
        "What are 3 different ways I could solve this?",
        "Which solution addresses the root cause vs. just symptoms?",
        "What could go wrong with each solution approach?",
        "How will I know if the solution actually worked?",
        "What would prevent this problem from happening again?"
    ]
    
    validation_questions = [
        "Did the fix actually solve the original problem?",
        "Did I break anything else in the process?",
        "Can I reproduce the success consistently?", 
        "What would I do differently if this happens again?",
        "How can I improve monitoring to catch this sooner?"
    ]

# Use this framework during troubleshooting
def apply_questioning_framework():
    log_enhanced("Starting systematic questioning process", "INFO", "apply_questioning_framework")
    
    for phase, questions in [
        ("Problem Definition", problem_definition_questions),
        ("Analysis", analysis_questions), 
        ("Solution Generation", solution_questions),
        ("Validation", validation_questions)
    ]:
        log_enhanced(f"Phase: {phase}", "INFO", "apply_questioning_framework")

        prefix = f"[{component}]"
        
        if function_name:
            prefix = f"{prefix} [{function_name}]"
        
        full_message = f"{prefix} [{level}] {message}"

        log_file = f"F:/Apps/freedom_system/log/{component_name.lower()}_troubleshooting.log"
        try:
